## About me
Hi, I'm Nikita, your friendly neighborhood front-end developer. 
Currently student at the institution of Noroff University in Norway. 

Before enrolling at the current institution in October 2022, I ended uo receiving a diploma as a qualified carpenter back in 2020. 
After receiving the diploma, I moved to Germany to pursue the study course of international business administration at the University of Hochschule Worms.
Came back to Norway to immerse myself in a new life full of sections and divs.
